## 📌 Project Overview
**VaultGuard Risk Intelligence** is an end-to-end machine learning solution designed to evaluate, predict, and visualize risk metrics. Whether deployed for credit scoring, fraud detection, or operational risk assessment, VaultGuard leverages advanced predictive modeling to transform raw data into actionable intelligence.

This repository contains the complete pipeline: from data ingestion and preprocessing to model training with XGBoost, and finally, a dynamic user-facing deployment utilizing Streamlit.

## 🎯 The Problem & The Approach

### The Problem
In modern financial and security ecosystems, manual risk assessment is slow, prone to human error, and unable to scale with massive datasets. Clients need a way to instantly evaluate risk profiles based on historical data, pinpointing high-risk entities before they impact the bottom line.

### The Approach
VaultGuard provides a **Decision Intelligence System**:

1. **Predictive Engine**
   - XGBoost model trained on historical data
   - Outputs probability of default / risk

2. **Automated Pipeline**
   - Data cleaning, feature engineering, retraining
   - Fully modular and reusable

3. **Interactive Dashboard**
   - User-friendly Streamlit interface
   - Real-time predictions + explanations

## ⚠️ Decision Intelligence Layer

The system converts raw probability scores into **actionable risk categories**:

- 🟢 **Low Risk** — likely safe, no immediate action required
- 🟡 **Medium Risk** — warrants closer review
- 🔴 **High Risk** — immediate intervention recommended

Each prediction includes:
- Risk probability score
- Key risk indicators
- Recommended action

## ✨ Features

### 🔢 Single Entry Mode
Input an individual's financial profile manually through the sidebar — sliders and input fields guide the user through each risk indicator. Instantly returns a risk classification, probability score, key risk drivers, and a recommended action.

### 📁 Batch CSV Mode
Upload a CSV file containing multiple records at once. VaultGuard processes every row through the same pipeline and returns a full results table with risk classifications and scores for each entry — ideal for bulk screening.

### 🛠️ Developer Pipeline (Backend)
1. **Data Preprocessing (`src/preprocessing.py`):** Raw data is ingested, missing values are handled, categorical variables are encoded, and numerical features are scaled.
2. **Model Training (`src/modeling/train_model.py`):** The processed data is fed into an XGBoost model. Hyperparameters are tuned to maximize accuracy and reliability.
3. **Serialization:** The winning model and the exact feature columns used are pickled into the `model/` directory.
4. **Continuous Learning (`retrain_pipeline.py`):** When new data arrives, this script can be executed to automatically run the preprocessing and training scripts, updating the `.pkl` files dynamically.

## 💻 Client Pipeline (Frontend)

Clients interact with VaultGuard entirely through the **Streamlit Dashboard** (`app/streamlit_app.py`).

1. **User Input:** The client enters parameters either manually via sidebar sliders/inputs or by uploading a batch CSV.
2. **Inference:** The app passes the inputs through the saved `feature_columns.pkl` structure to ensure the data matches the model's expectations, then calls `src/modeling/predict.py`.
3. **Actionable Output:** The dashboard displays:
   - The predicted Risk Score / Classification.
   - Probability scores for each risk category.
   - Interactive visualizations (generated via `src/visualization/plots.py`) explaining *why* the model made that decision (e.g., feature importance).

---

## 📊 The Data


- **Dataset:** Based on the [Give Me Some Credit](https://www.kaggle.com/c/GiveMeSomeCredit) dataset from Kaggle — a real-world financial dataset containing borrower attributes and historical default labels.
- **Features:** Key risk indicators extracted and engineered during the preprocessing phase (e.g., debt ratios, credit utilization, delinquency history).
- **Target Variable:** Binary — likelihood of a serious delinquency event occurring within 2 years.
